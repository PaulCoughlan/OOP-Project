For some unknown reason, the project will only run when a user uses the Run-File or Shift+F6 hotkey.

The notes section contains 2 parts, the first part is a group of flash cards divided into four topics of Volcanoes, Maps, Rocks and the Earth.
The other part called user notes allows a user to save six notes via the use of an Array. Since an array cannot be dynamically changed it will rely on a set size of 6.

The Image Gallery simply shows the user a bunch of pictures in each of the four topics.

The quiz section will have to wait until I use File I/O.
