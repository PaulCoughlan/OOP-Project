The notes section contains 2 parts, the first part is a group of flash cards divided into four topics of Volcanoes, Maps, Rocks and the Earth.
The other part called user notes allows a user to save six notes via the use of an Array. Since an array cannot be dynamically changed it will rely on a set size of 6.
The Notes section also contains File I/O

The Image Gallery simply shows the user a bunch of pictures in each of the four topics.

The Text Quiz allows the user to create 6 questions of their own and uses File I/O to save them

The quiz page I could not get this page to work, I had planned that it would challenge the user to maths problems but unfortunaltely I was unable to do so.

The notes page provides the user with the ability to save their own notes for their own benefit

The exam papers page has buttons linked to Exam Papers from years 2014 to 2011 higher and ordinary level.
